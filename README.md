# Hi, I’m Markus! 

I am a **robotics researcher** with many years of R&D experience in robotics motion control, software development for manipulators, and industrial applications (both onshore and offshore).  

I've worked in diverse fields such as the ship industry, where I developed electrical power systems and drives, and the Oil & Gas sector, focusing on subsea control systems.  

What I enjoy the most? Hands-on work in the lab with robots and the amazing people around me!
